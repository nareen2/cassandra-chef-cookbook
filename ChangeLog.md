Contributed by Geoff Hichborn

### additional chefspec tests to at least cover all resources

Tested with chef 0.9.0 but prior and later versions should still work.

run with
```
rake unit
```

Contributed by Bill Warner.

### Default to localhost-only JMX

The attribute `node[:cassandra][:local_jmx]` defaults to `true` now, making
JMX listen on localhost only. This is the default since cassandra 2.0.14 and
2.1.4 and fixes the remote code execution exploit from CVE-2015-0225.

Should you choose to enable remote JMX access by setting this to false, be aware
that this cookbook currently does not support configuring authentication for JMX,
so you should limit access to the JMX port by other means, such as firewalling.

Contributed by Bernhard Weisshuhn.

Contributed by Scott McMaster.

Contributed by Robert Berger.


## Changes Between 3.5.0 and 4.0.0

`4.0.0` has **breaking changes in attribute structure**.

### Node Config Attributes Moved

Node configuration attributes are now under `node['cassandra']['config']`. Since
there are many of them, please [consult the default attributes file](https://github.com/michaelklishin/cassandra-chef-cookbook/blob/master/attributes/config.rb).

### SHA 256 Checksums

SHA256 is now used instead of MD5 for checksums. The cookbook
now provides checksums for Cassandra versions up to 2.2.0.

### 2.2.0 by Default

The cookbook now provisions Cassandra 2.2.0 by default.


## Changes Between 3.4.0 and 3.5.0

### Seed Discovery Using Chef Search

The cookbook will now use Chef search to discover seed nodes.

GH issues: [#204](https://github.com/michaelklishin/cassandra-chef-cookbook/issues/204),
[#205](https://github.com/michaelklishin/cassandra-chef-cookbook/pull/205).

The following node attribute snippet enables Chef search and will list
IP addresses of nodes with roles `cassandra` and `cassandra-seed`:

``` json
  "cassandra": {
    "seed_discovery": {
      "use_chef_search": true,
      "search_query": "role:cassandra-seed OR role:cassandra"
    }
  }
```
